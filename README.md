### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested mostly in all kind of technologies. Most of them related to either modern software development and/or IoT/Smarthome/Industry4.0 applications.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Red Hat as transformation expert, both technology as well as people, process and proper leadership
